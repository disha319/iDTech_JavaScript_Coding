# Fortune Teller Activity
For this assignment, you’ll create a fortune teller game. The program should allow the user to pick a number between 0 to 10. Then, the program should read the number and output a fortune. If the number is between 0 and 3, then they have a low fortune. If the number is between 4 and 7, then they have an average fortune. If the number is between 8 and 10, then they have a great fortune. Otherwise, any other fortune should not be read by the program. To set up the game, you’ll use your programming skills to declare variables, use comparison operators, and create conditional statements.

 

Tasks

Follow the steps below to develop your program:

Create a variable called "fortune" and assign a number between 0 - 10.
If fortune is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 3, then you have a low fortune.
If fortune is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 7, then you have an average fortune.
If fortune is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 7, then you have an average fortune.
If the fortune is out of range, then the fortune can't be read correctly.
