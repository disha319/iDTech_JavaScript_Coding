# Working with Basic Data Types Activity
For this assignment, you’ll create a short story in VS Code. You’ll create variables to represent different elements of the story. The program should include the following basic data type variables: 1 array, 1 boolean, 3 integers, and 4 strings. To add more details to your story, you can create more variables as you develop the program. Once you have completed your program, you can copy and paste your code to JavaScript Tutor (Links to an external site.) to see how the variables are being stored in memory.

 

Tasks

Follow the steps below to develop your program:

Create 4-string variables to describe the plot and basics of your story.
Create 3-integer variables to describe the elements in your story such as age, year, and century.
Create 1-array variable to demonstrate a collection of items or powers your character might have.
Create 1-boolean variable to demonstrate a true or false scenario.
Use the console to write and print your story. Remember to use the concatenation symbol ( + ) to combine your variables to strings.
